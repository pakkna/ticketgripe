    <div class="row" style="padding: 10px;">
        <p>As ticket gripe is an online ticketing platform, we are strictly focused on keeping the privacy of the users private. That is why we imposed several measures to keep the data private in all cases. At the time of registering in our platform as a ticketing partner, you will receive all the access to make the changes you need to do for your event or ticketing. As most of the data you will receive is personally identifiable, it is recommended not to sell, share or collaborate these data with any third-party without any personal consent of the registrant.     
        </p>
        <p>
        For the safety of the data and tracking of the customer registration we are suggesting you to follow the following terms:
